Standard Windows Programming

Programming Windows ways intended by its creators.

This is an abandoned project.

There are a couple of interesting design tidbits in here though.

LayeredWindow - dealing with writing transparent windows 

mmap - simplified memory mapped files

PixelOps - relatively fast pixel transfer operations

random - a random number generator, taken from the LuaJIT project

stopwatch - Quick and dirty no-cost stop watch.  It uses high frequency timers in the system to give you fairly accucate times, which can be used
for other actions

Thread - A class that simplifies doing threads in Windows
